# Technic Launcher

`technic-launcher` will guide you through the install process, just like it
normally would.

Some modpacks will complain about libraries, and that is expected. In such
cases you may want to enable the `withSteamRun = true;` override flag. This
will run `technic-launcher` with `steam-run` and prevent those errors.
